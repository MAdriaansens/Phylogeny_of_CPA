All starting data is publically available data. 
Resources used include HMMs and sequences from Pfam and proteomes/metadata from GTDB. 
NCBI proteomes/genomes was used to generate most of the Eukaryotic database.

On 16th of April 2025 GTDB released its latest version GTDB 226.
On 5th May 2025 we started downloading this data, this included:
         - all metadata from Archaea and Bacteria
         - the proteomes from all representatives

After succesfull download all data will be compiled into a proteome database and tsv for both Archaea and Bacteria
After which this homology searches will be performed
