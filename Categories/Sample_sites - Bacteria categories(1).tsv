this genome was reconstructed from an aerobic pyrene degrading enrichment culture grown from soil-compost microcosms; as described in adam i.k. et al.; under review. an uncontaminated and unfertilized agricultural soil (ap horizon of a haplic chernozem) of the static fertilization experiment bad lauchstadt (germany) was supplemented with mature compost (bio-komp sas gmbh; weizenfels; germany) for biostimulation; the compost consisted of a mixture of vegetable and animal organic waste. two stable enrichment cultures (uc1 and uc10) capable of total pyrene (spiked at a concentration of 100 mg/l) mineralization were obtained from the microscosm and shotgun sequenced (see adam i.k. et al.; under review 2016).
